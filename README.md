# HOLaGraF: Topological Stability for higher-order graph Laplacian operators

This repository provides the code for **H**igher-**O**rder **La**placian **Gra**dient  **F**low for "Quantifying the structural stability of simplicial homology" by _Nicola Guglielmi_, _Anton Savostianov_ and _Francesco Tudisco_.

> We provide the documentation and examples for the implementation of the gradient flow algorithm in `julia`. You can find the implementation in `matlab` that supports a similar code structure.
